# Condor-Waypoint-File-Generator
This application parses Condor Soaring Simulator .APT (Airport) associated with a scenery/landscape, and writes
the information out in .CUP format usable by most popular soaring navigation apps/devices.  It was recently updated
to be compatible with the .APT format created by Landscape Editor 2.01 (LE2.01).
